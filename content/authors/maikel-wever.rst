Maikel has done his internship for his study 'Computer Science', at Paylogic, which was a great experience.
He's a Python lover, but spent his internship doing Java, writing plugins for Bamboo and Jenkins CIs.
Most of his time he works on a Linux desktop, but he reluctantly reboots every now and then to Windows, to play some games.

You can contact him by e-mail on: `maikel@maikelwever.nl`_.
